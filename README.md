# DASTScanK8s: Enterprise-Grade DevSecOps Pipeline

> **A modern, fully automated security testing infrastructure for today's cloud-native applications**

## Executive Summary

The DASTScanK8s project represents a comprehensive DevSecOps implementation that seamlessly integrates security throughout the entire software development lifecycle. It serves as a showcase of industry best practices for organizations seeking to adopt a "shift-left" security approach while maintaining deployment velocity.

This enterprise-ready solution combines Static Application Security Testing (SAST), Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), and Software Composition Analysis (SCA) in an automated pipeline that scales with your development teams and provides actionable security insights without slowing delivery.

## Key Business Benefits

- **Reduced Security Risks**: Catch vulnerabilities before they reach production
- **Accelerated Compliance**: Automate security checks required for SOC2, ISO27001, and PCI-DSS
- **Lower Operational Costs**: Eliminate manual security testing and reduce incident response time
- **Improved Developer Experience**: Security feedback within familiar tools and workflows
- **Faster Time-to-Market**: Security testing that keeps pace with agile development

## Technical Highlights

### 🔍 Comprehensive Security Testing

This project demonstrates the implementation and orchestration of:

- **SAST (Static Application Security Testing)**: Code-level vulnerability detection via SonarQube integration, identifying issues like SQL injection, XSS, and insecure coding patterns without execution
- **DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)**: Real-time attack simulation against running applications using OWASP ZAP, detecting runtime vulnerabilities missed by static analysis
- **SCA (Software Composition Analysis)**: Identification of vulnerable open-source dependencies and license compliance issues in the application supply chain
- **Container Security Scanning**: Detecting vulnerabilities in container images before deployment to production

### 🚀 Modern DevOps Approach

Built on a foundation of DevOps excellence:

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Complete AWS infrastructure provisioned through version-controlled Terraform modules
- **Immutable Infrastructure**: Consistent environments with containerized applications and infrastructure
- **CI/CD Automation**: Zero-touch deployment pipeline through Jenkins with quality gates
- **Cloud-Native Architecture**: Leveraging AWS managed services (EKS, ECR) for scalability and reliability
- **GitOps Workflow**: Infrastructure and application changes through pull requests and code reviews

### 🛡️ Security Automation & Orchestration

Rather than just scanning, this project demonstrates how to:

- **Automate Remediation**: Auto-generation of pull requests for vulnerable dependencies
- **Security Policy as Code**: Define security requirements as machine-readable policies
- **Continuous Compliance**: Real-time monitoring and enforcement of security standards
- **Security Metrics Dashboard**: Visualization of security posture across applications
- **Vulnerability Management**: Complete tracking from detection to resolution

## Implementation Architecture

The architecture implements a full security-focused deployment pipeline with:

## Jenkins Pipeline Implementation

Our CI/CD pipeline is implemented using a sophisticated Jenkins pipeline that automates the entire application lifecycle from code to production:

### Pipeline Features

- **Automated Code Analysis**: Integration with SonarCloud for comprehensive static code analysis
- **Containerization**: Multi-stage Docker builds with security scanning and verification
- **Container Registry Integration**: Automated pushing to AWS ECR with proper tagging and versioning
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: Seamless deployment to EKS with namespace management and rollout verification
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Detailed diagnostics and recovery procedures for pipeline failures
- **Deployment Verification**: Automated verification of successful deployments with service endpoint validation

The pipeline handles the complete workflow:
1. Code analysis and quality verification
2. Secure Docker image building and scanning
3. Image publication to ECR with multiple tagging strategies
4. Kubernetes deployment with namespace management
5. Deployment verification and service validation
6. Comprehensive reporting and documentation

This implementation demonstrates how security can be integrated into every step of the development process without sacrificing deployment speed.
